# Predictive-maintenance-for-machine-Failure
Developed an ML model for predictive maintenance using the AI4I 2020 dataset. The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow, from data analysis and preprocessing with a scikit-learn pipeline to model training. The goal is to predict machine failures to minimize downtime and optimize maintenance.
